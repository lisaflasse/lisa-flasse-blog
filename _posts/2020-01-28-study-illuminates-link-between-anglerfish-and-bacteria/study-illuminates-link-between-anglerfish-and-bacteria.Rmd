| General topic                                  | Deep-sea anglerfishes are relatively abundant and diverse, but their luminescent bacterial symbionts remain enigmatic.                                                                                                             |
| Procedure                                      | To determine how anglerfish symbionts are transmitted, researchers analyzed bacteria-host codivergence across six diverse anglerfish species.                                                                                      |
| Conclusion                                     | This study leads to the conclusion that diverse anglerfishes share symbionts that are acquired from the environment, and that these bacteria have undergone extreme genome reduction although they are not vertically transmitted. |
