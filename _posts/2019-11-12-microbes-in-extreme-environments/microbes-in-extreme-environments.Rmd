title: "Article 3 : Microbes in extreme environments"
description: |
  The study of extremophilic organisms revealed a third life form different from bacteria and eukaryotes. These organisms, called Archaea, are abundant in the environment. Contrary to what one might think, these organisms are not in “survival” conditions but really need conditions considered hostile in order to develop. Moreover, Archea have evolutionary links with our cells, representing unique models for understanding the origin and functioning of complex cellular processes.

| Conclusion               | They play important roles in the regulation of major geochemical cycles and potentially constitute a reservoir of new biocatalysts for future technologies.
their contribution to the production of greenhouse gases, and to the major carbon, nitrogen and nitrate cycles, is far from negligible
Understanding the mechanisms that stabilize biological macromolecules under extreme conditions is not only useful for understanding:
- the origins and expansion capacities of living organisms,
- the fundamental processes that govern the functioning of proteins and
- the universal cellular processes designed to maintain the integrity of cellular machinery.
Enzymes are natural products that perform chemical reactions in an ultra-efficient and non-polluting way. Indeed, their robustness, their ability to perform chemical reactions under extreme conditions and sometimes the uniqueness of the chemical reactions they perform make them very interesting for multiple applications. For example, biotechnologies use extremozymes for the production of biofuels, bio-materials or pharmaceutical molecules. hyperstable enzymes that can be used for food applications under conditions that eliminate the risk of bacterial contamination.        |
