| General topic            | Arsenic-resistant nematodes have been found in Mono Lake, a place where few species are able to thrive because of the high arsenic concentration and the salinity.                                                                               |
| Procedure                | Researchers  went to a nematodes collecting trip in Mono Lake (by scooping up the lake soil), and analyzed their genomes.                                                                                                                        |
| Conclusion               | Researchers collected 8 species of nematodes, including 5 which haven't been described yet. It has also been said that these species can thrive into such environments thanks to a mutation of a gene that is involved in amino acid metabolism. |
