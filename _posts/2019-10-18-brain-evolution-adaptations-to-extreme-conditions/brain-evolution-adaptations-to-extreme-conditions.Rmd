| General topic       | Study of the brain architecture of shrimps living in deep-sea vents                                                                                                            |
| Procedure           | It has been demonstrated that the anatomy and the physiology can adapt due to extreme conditions, but the brain architecture could also provide clues about how some organisms are able to live in extreme environments, such as deep-sea vents in this case.                                |
| Conclusion          | The brain of the shrimp *R. exoculata* has actually evolved in response to low light levels and an irregular chemical environment. Their hemiellipsoid bodies are particularly atypical, which suggests that these parts have evolved to provide these animals additionnal functions for them to survive in deep-sea vents.                                                                                         |
| Remaining questions | The hemiellipsoid bodies in crustaceans could contribute to the processing of the sensory information and to memory.                                                            |
