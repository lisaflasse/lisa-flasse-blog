| General topic       | Study of the brain architecture of shrimps living in deep-sea vents                                                                                                            |
| Procedure           | The brain architecture could actually provide clues about how some organisms are able to live in extreme environments, such as deep-sea vents in this case                     |
| Remaining questions | The hemiellipsoid bodies in crustaceans could contribute to the processing of the sensory information and to memory                                                            |
